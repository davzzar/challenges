# Challanges

Here, I put all of the coding challanges that I undertake in my free time.

A challenge such as _"Implement a Merge Sort in [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/)"_ shall be found in `/impement/mege_sort/`. Challenges such that would require multiple files shall also be organised by language or framework such as `/project/dart/terminal_messenger/` Other challanges will be organised similarly by category and/or language.
